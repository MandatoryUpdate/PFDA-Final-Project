Title
 - Infinite Jumper
Repository
 - https://github.com/MandatoryUpdate/PFDA-Final-Project.git
Description
 - The goal is to make an infinitely going top-down jumping game moving from platform to platform.
Features
 - A scoring mechanic based on total height
 - A jumping/movement mechanic for the player
 - A platforming mechanic based on randomly generated platforms
 - A infinitely scrolling screen (So as the player moves, the screen consistently outputs movement.)
Challenges
 - A good knowledge of either PyGame or some other library that works with games.
Outcomes
    1. Ideal Outcome
        A fully functioning game, where all the separate mechanics not only work, but work together in tandem.
    2. Minimal Viable Outcome
        While not a fully functioning game, all separate mechanics display some form of functionality, even if they do not work perfectly in tandem with other mechanics.
